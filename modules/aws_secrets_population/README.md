Mini-module used for fetching pre-existing `access_key` and `secret_key` values from AWS Secrets Manager. This is useful when your AWS credentials have been provisioned for you by the likes of [Account Factory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/controltower/latest/userguide/account-factory.html). The values are then placed in the created workspace, same as if this module generated them.
